00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,700
If you recall our story about you debugging late in the night,

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:09,000
with your significant other calling you, and you not knowing what to do,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
let me now come up with a way to avoid all of this.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The answer here is Explicit Debugging.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,500
What does Explicit Debugging mean? It's simple.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,000
When you're debugging late in the night,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,500
it's usually because you try to keep everything in your head.

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,000
You're making the hypothesis in your head, you're running the experiment,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,200
and you're keeping the results of the experiment in your head.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,500
This is okay for 5 minutes,

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,500
but the longer this goes on, the harder it becomes to actually memorize all of this.

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,000
And this is why everything gets so intense.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You're so concentrated on trying to figure out what is going on,

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and this is why nobody can disturb you--because then you'd get out of your trance.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,500
And the alternative to this implicit debugging where you're keeping

16
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,000
everything in your head, of course, is explicit debugging.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Explicit debugging at first simply means to write down what you're doing,

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,500
make notes of what you see, make notes of what you expect,

19
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,500
and make notes of what your current hypothesis is.

20
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,000
A common format for this, for instance, is to write down

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,700
what the input was or generally what the experiment is,

22
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,500
what you expected to see, and what you got instead.

23
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,300
You may even want to write down the current hypothesis you're working on

24
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,800
and whether this hypothesis is confirmed or rejected.

25
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:39,000
This way you keep a log of your actions, and this log gives you multiple advantages.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
To start, you can always revise what you actually did and what the result was,

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
so you don't have to memorize it, and you don't have to repeat it.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Secondly, you can resume the session at any time

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,700
because everything is already written down.

30
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,100
You don't have to store this in your head.

31
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,300
When your significant other calls you and asks you out for a nice dinner--

32
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,000
well, everything is written down, and you can resume the next morning

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
with a fresh mind and a nice dinner on top.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,200
The third advantage, however, is that when you write things down and see them again--

35
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:20,300
this often already bears the solution at hand because forcing you to become explicit

36
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:26,000
frequently makes it clear to you what the problem actually is,

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,600
so it structures your thinking, and it helps you organize your thinking

38
00:02:30,600 --> 99:59:59,000
towards successful debugging.

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This technique of using the most obvious fix, so beautiful--I'd really like to show this to you.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So here we have a complete program again. I managed to restore each from previous backup.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And again, if we run this, you'll see that the HTML markup is not removed.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So the technique of using the most obvious fix is very simple.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We simply check for the input that's wrong and return the correct output.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Lo and behold, this technique beautifully works and returns the correct output.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Rumor has it that some programmers use this very technique to make their unit test work.

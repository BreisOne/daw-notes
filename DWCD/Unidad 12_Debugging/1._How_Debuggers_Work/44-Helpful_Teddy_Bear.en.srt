00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Here's a story that is reported by Kernighan and Pike

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,800
in their book, "The Practice of Programming."

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:11,000
One university computer center kept a teddy bear near the help desk.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Students with mysterious bugs were required to explain the problems to the bear

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
before they could speak to a human counselor.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Picture that--speak to a bear, and in two thirds of all cases,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
the problem would resolve itself.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,000
That's how effective explicit debugging is.

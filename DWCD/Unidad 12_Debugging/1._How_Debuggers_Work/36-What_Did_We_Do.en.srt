1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What is it we have seen? We have started with an initial hypothesis.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
From this hypothesis we have made predictions. We have made experiments.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We checked with the experiments, validated the prediction.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
If they did, we refined our hypothesis. If they didn't, we came up with alternate hypothesis.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We have repeated the process until we came up with a diagnosis.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That is, a theory that is consistent with our earlier observations, and that also

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
predicts future observations. In our case, the correct behavior.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Based on this diagnosis, how the failure came to be, we have fixed a code

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
accordingly, and we have seen in our additional experiments that the theory holds.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That is, the diagnosis was valid from the beginning on,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and therefore, was a correct explanation of how the failure came to be.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Note that there are many ways to come up with an initial hypothesis.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
There are also many ways to refine a hypothesis and reject a hypothesis.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Note that there may be multiple hypotheses to start with,

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and also of course during the scientific method, you may come up with different hypotheses.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
If you have two competing hypotheses for the same failure,

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
what you do is set up an experiment that decides which of the hypotheses

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
is supported, and which of the hypotheses is rejected.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
At the end, there should be only one hypothesis, there should be only one

20
00:01:16,000 --> 99:59:59,000
theory, and there should be only one diagnosis on how the failure came to be.

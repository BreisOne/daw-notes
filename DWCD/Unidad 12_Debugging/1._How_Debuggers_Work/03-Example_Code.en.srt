If you've taken a Udacity class before, you've probably seen the Udacity IDE--well, IDE.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's a webpage where you can enter arbitrary Python functions

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and Python commands and execute them.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
For instance, we can have it say hello for some wrong and then we get the output hello.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let us now write a function which implements the finite state machine we just seen

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
in order to remove HTML markup.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We have the tag variable, which tells us which state we're in,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and we have an out variable, which tells us what the output would be.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Here's an implementation of the finite state machine.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
If we see the beginning of an HTML tag, we set the tag variable to two, so we go into tag mode.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If we see the end of HTML markup, we set tag to false, so we exit tag mode.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Otherwise, for all other characters, we add them to the output unless we're in tag mode.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And finally, we return the output. Here's the input we just saw.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We have a bold HTML tag, we have a foo as text,

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and we have an end-of-bold HTML markup in here.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If all works well, then we should get just foo as the output

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and all the HTML markup should be removed.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So we take on run and we get foo as the output--that is I removed HTML markup function,

19
00:01:13,000 --> 99:59:59,000
has properly stripped the bold and unbold markup from the input.

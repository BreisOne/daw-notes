00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This quiz can easily be answered if you recall our initial state diagram.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Initially, we were in the state no quote, no tag.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
If we see a beginning of a tag, we go into the no quote and tag mode.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And in this mode, we can go into quote and tag mode, from which we exit

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
again by seeing a closely quote, and when we see the closing tag,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
we go back into the non-quote, non-tag mode.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
These are the three states that a program can be in. Which state is missing?

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The state that is missing is the state in which we would have quotes,

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
but we are outside of tags.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
This is exactly the problem we would be handling in our program.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We would take care of quotes, even outside of tags.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This state should not be reached.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So how can we express this with our assert statement?

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
What we want to make sure of is that this state can never be reached.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So this is quote and not tag. The inversion of this is tag or not quote.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You can see that either we are in non-quote mode, or if we are in quote mode

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
then we are in tag mode, and the assertion that actually checks this is this one.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 99:59:59,000
This is, therefore, the correct answer.

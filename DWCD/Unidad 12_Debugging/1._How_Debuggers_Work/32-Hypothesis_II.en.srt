00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Here comes the answer--as you probably found out for yourself, the program indeed

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
raises an exception that is the quote condition holds, and this confirms our hypothesis.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So at this point, let us recall what we have seen.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The error is due to the quote condition evaluating to true. We've seen that and confirm the experiments.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Before, we already had seen that the error is due to tag being set was rejected--

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
that is tag is not being set.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Our initial hypothesis and our initial observation double quotes our stripped from the input.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So we know at this point double quotes are stripped, tag is not being set,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and the quote condition evaluates to true.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
At this point our program is supposed to be complete, but it still has a bug.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
If we put in foo in bold, in quotes as input, what would we expect is an output of foo?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
However, what we get is a completely different output.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What we get is an output where the quotes are stripped but the HTML tags are still there

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and obviously, the output does not match what we actually expect it--we do have a bug in here.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
When I was a student, I never got any formal training in debugging.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I had to figure out how to do the debugging myself. What I learned was how to use debugging output.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That is I would go and scatter output statements everywhere in my program.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
In Python, this would be the infamous print statement.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So here again, here is our program and here's the one single input that goes wrong.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
If you press on run, what we get is the quotes removed but the HTML markup is still there.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
When I was a student, I never got any formal training in debugging,

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
so I had now to figure out myself what went wrong.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The only thing I knew was how to use debugging output, so I would use the print statement in Python

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
in order to figure out what had gone wrong.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Essentially, I would go and scatter print statements everywhere.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
For instance, I can go and print all the local variables in here. Cool.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So I know what the character is, I know what the status of tag and quote is.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Now, we'll click on run--oh yeah, and here comes my big output.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Now, I can scroll down here and say, "Oh yeah, sure, sure, sure."

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Obviously, of course now you can immediately see what's going on in here.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
No, I'm afraid I can't because this is just a long, long list.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Think of a 1000 character input at this time.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
If you have a 1000 character input, you didn't have to go through 3000 lines of logs.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This may help you but it's a total time waster.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You have to enter these statements, use them for debugging and then remove them again.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
It is a total maintenance nightmare.

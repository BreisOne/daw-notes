1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So what we have at this point is that the condition in our code becomes true

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
when we see a double quote and it becomes false when we see a single quote.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
At this point, we should have enough material to solve the problem.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
What's the correct way to fix this condition--

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
should it be a check for the just double quotes and single quotes and tags,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
should we go and invert the condition such that not tag is being checked,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
should we put parenthesis around the or condition,

8
00:00:29,000 --> 99:59:59,000
or should it be none of the above and something completely different.

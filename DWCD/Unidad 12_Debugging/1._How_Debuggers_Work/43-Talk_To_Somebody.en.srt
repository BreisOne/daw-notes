00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Sometimes it helps a lot simply to tell a colleague or a friend what you're up to.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This is the problem I'm working on,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
this is what I'm seeing, this is what I tried out.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In my experience, in 2 out of 3 cases,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
the problem resolves itself simply by telling it.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
When I was a teaching assistant at the university,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
students would come to me and come out with all sorts of problems.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Now I'm a professor; they only come with the hard problems.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
But when I was a teaching assistant, they would come along

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and say something like, "Oh, Andres, Andres, you know, I have this problem over here.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You see, here's this loop, and in this loop we have this binary search tree,

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and you know, I've been adding 2 elements here, added 3 elements here,

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and more and more and more, and now I'm doing this and I'm doing that,

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm deleting over here, but. . ."

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And of course I didn't understand a single thing.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But I was still there and nodding and saying "yes, yes, yes, sure," as you do,

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
but then the student would come up and say,

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
"Oh, actually, now that I'm saying it, I'm not deleting anything at all.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I think, yes! It must be! If the element is not in the tree,

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yes, the element is not in the tree, that's why it's not deleting!

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Thank you Andres! Thank you so very much, everything is just beautiful.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Thank you so much for helping me out here."

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I was happy, the student was happy, and I hadn't done anything.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Of course, occasionally there were also problems

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
where students would really come along and have real problems,

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and then ask me with a big puzzled face, and then I would have to come up again and say,

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
"Okay, okay. Can you repeat this a bit slower?

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What's this thing about foo and a binary tree and the quotes and the tags and everything?"

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And then we would go into regular debugging, but in two-thirds of the cases, yup!

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Simply by listening, I would be able to debug it.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Hey! I was a king of debugging.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Indeed, the answer is that you should understand what the problem is,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
because if you don't understand what the problem is, how would you be able to fix it.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Understand what the code should do because again if you don't know what the code should do,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
you won't know how to fix it.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And finally, also apply a fix that addresses the problem

6
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and not only the symptom but the actual cause.

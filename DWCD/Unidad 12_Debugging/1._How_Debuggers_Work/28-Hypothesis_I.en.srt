1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
If this is our hypothesis, we now must devise an experiment to further refine this hypothesis.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Let's come up with a very simple input where we'd assume that this quote.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
If we put in just "foo" without any ten, we would assume that we would get the very same amount.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Let's do this as an experiment.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Here again, we have a buggy function  and now let's conduct the experiment.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So we invoke print html marker with "foo".

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We press run and the output is foo without double quote.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So now we see the output. It's not what we expected.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The output will be foo without quote and this again confirm our hypothesis.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We can try this out with even more strength. Further strengthening our hypothesis.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So if we put in bar and very surprising it's going to happen.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We get bar as output and we put in just a two quotes.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
what we get is an empty strength so we get more failures down the lane.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This hypothesis is confirmed now by a number of experiment

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
double quote our strip from tagged input, but actually we don't even have a new tag

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
so we can actually scratch that.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Double quote are stripped from general input.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So even if there's no tag these quotes are being stripped away.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Now we can actually go and explore the cause-effect chain.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
If quotes have been stripped away, there must be a place in the code which doesn't.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The only place in our code where codes are handle right here in this line

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and we have if there's a double quote or a single quote and tag is being set

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
then quote be inverted and when quote is inverted, tags should not be recognize.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Nothing to complicate but the why would the quote be script because normally we should not be in tag.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Maybe we are in tag. Maybe the variable tag is set.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So we can come up with a new hypothesis that explains precisely that.

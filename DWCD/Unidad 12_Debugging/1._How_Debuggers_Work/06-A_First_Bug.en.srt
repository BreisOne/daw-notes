00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The problem we're having here is that we're not taking care of the quotes in the HTML markup.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Actually, anything that's within these quotes in HTML markup should not end HTML markup.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
In particular, not the greater sign in here, so we need to extend a program appropriately.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The idea was as follows--rather than having two states, one for regular text

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and one for HTML markup, we're going to have a third state,

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
which would handle anything that's within quotes.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Just as before, we start in a non-tag mode and when we see a less than sign, we go into tag mode.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This is what we do when we possess this very input and we stay in this mode until we find a quote--

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
that's when we go in quote mode and we stay in quote mode until we find another quote.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That's when we go back into tag mode, which happens right here.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
When we see the greater sign, we exit tag mode and we possess the individual characters,

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and we add them to the output.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Thus our output should now become foo as expected.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The remaining tag is processed just as before.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
In order to implement this, we're going to use two variables--

16
00:01:03,000 --> 99:59:59,000
one variable tag and one variable quote to indicate the three different states a program can be.
